<section class="Overview">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  Hi, I'm Guglielmo 👋. I've spent the last 6 years leading AI projects for the semiconductor industry — co-founding and serving as CTO 
  of a startup where we grew the team from 2 to 20 and built and deployed AI systems — and more than 8 years in academic research, 
  mostly at the intersection of machine learning and robotics.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My current research interests focus on embodied AI, vision–language–action models, and self-supervised architectures — basically
  teaching machines to perceive, act, and learn like humans do.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Outside of work, I live in the countryside, grow my own vegetables 🌱, and teach yoga. I'm passionate about 
  building a life—and maybe a future society—that is self-sufficient, sustainable, mindful, and compassionate…with plenty of robots all around! 🤖🙂

        <strong>Towards smarter Vision-Language-Action models</strong><br />
        In this document, I outline what I consider to be the main limitations of Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models and propose potential ways to address them. The architecture I suggest offers several advantages:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Extension of VJepa:</strong> Fully self-supervised, eliminating the need to collect data through teleoperation of the robot.</li>
          <li><strong>Explicit Hierarchical Representation of Sensorimotor Loops:</strong> Supports both fast and slow robot control loops, reducing latency issues common in large VLA models.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration of Sensor, Motor, and Planning Capabilities:</strong> Sensors and motors are represented at multiple levels of abstraction, allowing the architecture to create a cohesive representation. This improves the robot's efficiency in determining the appropriate motor plan to interact with objects in the visual scene.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>I would love to hear your feedback!!</strong> You can access the full document via the link below.

      <p><strong>Curiosity‑Driven Exploration in Robots</strong><br />
      I am fascinated by how intrinsically motivated agents — both biological and artificial — explore and learn about their environments through 
      self‑driven interaction rather than external supervision. This interest builds on sensorimotor approaches to perception and cognition, 
      such as the FEEL project led by <a href="http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/" target="_blank">Kevin O'Regan</a>, 
      During this project, I participated in several studies and experiments on sensorimotor contingency learning in infants, including work on infants’ sensitivity
      to real-time arm-movement contingencies. I also contributed to the design of a robotized pacifier and a baby-gym, both created to 
      study how babies discover and interact with sensorimotor regularities.
